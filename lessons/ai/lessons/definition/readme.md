### **Core Capabilities in AI Systems**

AI involves enabling machines to:

* **Perceive**: sense and interpret the environment (e.g., vision, speech).
* **Reason**: make logical deductions or predictions.
* **Learn**: adapt behavior based on data and experiences.
* **Act**: take decisions or perform actions.
* **Interact**: communicate with humans or other systems.

### **Broad Categories of AI**

| Type           | Description                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Narrow AI**  | Specialized in one task (e.g., face recognition, language translation). |
| **General AI** | Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can.     |
| **Super AI**   | Theoretical AI surpassing human intelligence in all fields.             |
