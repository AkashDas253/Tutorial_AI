### **I. AI Ethics Principles**

| Principle               | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fairness**            | Preventing bias, discrimination, and ensuring equitable treatment for all users and stakeholders. |
| **Accountability**      | Identifying who is responsible for AI decisions and actions; ensuring recourse for harm.          |
| **Transparency**        | Making AI systems and their decisions explainable, understandable, and auditable.                 |
| **Privacy**             | Safeguarding personal data and respecting user consent.                                           |
| **Safety and Security** | Ensuring AI does not cause physical, psychological, financial, or reputational harm.              |
| **Autonomy**            | Respecting human agency and decision-making; avoiding manipulative behavior.                      |
| **Sustainability**      | Minimizing environmental impact (e.g., carbon footprint of training large models).                |
| **Beneficence**         | Promoting societal good and human well-being.                                                     |
| **Non-maleficence**     | Avoiding actions that cause harm.                                                                 |

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Algorithmic Bias**           | Facial recognition performing poorly on minority groups; biased credit scoring. |
| **Surveillance**               | AI used in mass monitoring and social control (e.g., authoritarian regimes).    |
| **Deepfakes & Misinformation** | AI-generated fake videos, voices, and news undermining truth.                   |
| **Autonomous Weapons**         | AI used for lethal autonomous decision-making.                                  |
| **Manipulative Interfaces**    | Recommender systems promoting addiction or polarization.                        |
| **Displacement of Labor**      | Mass automation without social or economic safety nets.                         |
