### **Expanded Perspectives on AI Goals**

#### **1. Cognitive Replication**

* Replicate human abilities like memory, attention, decision-making, reasoning, creativity.

#### **2. Automation of Tasks**

* Automate repetitive, dangerous, or complex tasks with high efficiency and consistency.

#### **3. Human Augmentation**

* Enhance human abilities via assistive AI (e.g., decision support, smart assistants).

#### **4. Decision Support**

* Aid humans in making better, faster, data-driven decisions (e.g., in medicine, finance).

#### **5. Environment Interaction**

* Enable systems to sense, act, and learn in real-time physical or virtual environments.

#### **6. Self-Improvement**

* Develop systems that can optimize or evolve their own architecture or parameters (e.g., AutoML, meta-learning).

#### **7. Explainability & Trust**

* Provide transparency in decision-making to increase human trust and system accountability.
