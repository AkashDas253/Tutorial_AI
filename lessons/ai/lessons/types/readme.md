## **Types of Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

---

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be categorized in two primary ways:

* **Based on Capabilities** ‚Äì Level of intelligence relative to human ability
* **Based on Functionalities** ‚Äì How the AI system operates internally

### **I. Types of AI Based on Capabilities**

| Type                         | Description                                                                           | Current Status                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Narrow AI** *(Weak AI)*    | AI designed to perform a specific task or a narrow range of tasks.                    | Already in use (e.g., Siri, Google Maps) |
| **General AI** *(Strong AI)* | AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can do, with cognitive flexibility. | Still theoretical                        |
| **Super AI**                 | Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.                     | Conceptual (future)                      |

#### üîπ Narrow AI (ANI: Artificial Narrow Intelligence)

* Specializes in one task.
* No consciousness, emotion, or self-awareness.
* Examples: Spam filters, recommendation engines, facial recognition.

#### üîπ General AI (AGI: Artificial General Intelligence)

* Human-level understanding across domains.
* Capable of reasoning, learning, and adapting like a human.
* Requires cognitive architecture, memory, consciousness.

#### üîπ Super AI (ASI: Artificial Super Intelligence)

* Exceeds human intellectual and emotional intelligence.
* May be capable of innovation, ethical reasoning, self-improvement.
* Poses major ethical, existential risks.

### **II. Types of AI Based on Functionalities**

| Type                  | Characteristics                                         | Memory          | Learning |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| **Reactive Machines** | No memory, responds to current input only               | ‚ùå               | ‚ùå        |
| **Limited Memory**    | Remembers limited past data to make better decisions    | ‚úÖ               | ‚úÖ        |
| **Theory of Mind**    | Understands emotions, beliefs, and intentions of others | üîÑ In progress  | ‚úÖ        |
| **Self-Aware AI**     | Has consciousness and self-awareness                    | ‚ùå (theoretical) | ‚úÖ        |

#### üîπ Reactive Machines

* No past memory or learning.
* Task-specific behavior.
* Example: IBM Deep Blue (Chess)

#### üîπ Limited Memory

* Stores short-term experiences for decision-making.
* Used in self-driving cars, fraud detection.
* Example: Tesla Autopilot

#### üîπ Theory of Mind AI

* Understands human emotions, beliefs, intent.
* Enables empathy, social interactions.
* Needed for advanced robots, assistants.
* Still under research.

#### üîπ Self-Aware AI

* Has self-consciousness and understands its own state.
* Capable of metacognition (thinking about thinking).
* Hypothetical; may lead to Artificial Super Intelligence.

### **III. AI Based on Application Domains** *(Extended Classification)*

| Type                  | Application Example                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Analytical AI**     | Uses cognitive learning (e.g., data analytics)    |
| **Human-Inspired AI** | Combines cognitive and emotional intelligence     |
| **Humanized AI**      | Includes cognitive, emotional, and social aspects |
| **Embodied AI**       | AI inside physical bodies (e.g., robots, drones)  |
| **Symbolic AI**       | Rule-based logical systems                        |
| **Subsymbolic AI**    | Pattern recognition (e.g., neural networks)       |
| **Hybrid AI**         | Combines symbolic and subsymbolic approaches      |
