### **Definition of Deep Learning (DL)**

**Deep Learning** is a subfield of **Machine Learning (ML)** that uses **artificial neural networks with multiple layers** (hence "deep") to automatically learn representations and patterns from large volumes of data.

### **Key Characteristics of Deep Learning**

* Learns features **hierarchically** (from simple edges to complex patterns)
* Requires **large datasets** and **high computational power**
* Often achieves **state-of-the-art performance** in tasks like image, text, and speech processing
* Reduces the need for **manual feature engineering**

### **Formal View**

Deep learning models aim to approximate complex functions by **stacking multiple nonlinear transformations**:

$$
f(x) = f_n(f_{n-1}(...f_2(f_1(x))))
$$

Where each function \$f\_i\$ is typically a layer like convolution, activation, or normalization.
