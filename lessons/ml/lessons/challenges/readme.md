### **1. Data Challenges**

| Challenge                     | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Insufficient Data**         | Not enough data to train robust models                                         |
| **Imbalanced Datasets**       | One class dominates (e.g., fraud detection), leading to biased predictions     |
| **Noisy Data**                | Errors, irrelevant features, or mislabeled samples                             |
| **Missing Values**            | Incomplete records reduce model performance or increase complexity             |
| **High Dimensionality**       | Too many features cause overfitting and inefficiency (curse of dimensionality) |
| **Data Drift**                | Real-world data distribution changes over time                                 |
| **Data Privacy & Compliance** | Restrictions due to GDPR, HIPAA, etc.                                          |

### **2. Model Challenges**

| Challenge                  | Description                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overfitting**            | Model memorizes training data, fails to generalize              |
| **Underfitting**           | Model too simple, fails to capture patterns                     |
| **Model Interpretability** | Difficult to understand complex models (e.g., deep neural nets) |
| **Hyperparameter Tuning**  | Large space, trial-and-error, costly to compute                 |
| **Scalability**            | Difficult to train large models on large datasets               |
| **Latency Constraints**    | Real-time predictions need optimized models                     |

### **3. Algorithmic Challenges**

| Challenge                        | Description                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Choosing the Right Algorithm** | Depends on data, goals, interpretability, etc.            |
| **Bias in Algorithms**           | Prejudice in data or model leads to unfair outcomes       |
| **Optimization Difficulties**    | Gradient vanishing/exploding, local minima, non-convexity |

### **4. Deployment & Maintenance Challenges**

| Challenge                | Description                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Integration**          | Making models compatible with existing systems         |
| **Model Versioning**     | Managing and tracking multiple model iterations        |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | Detecting model drift, data shifts, or system failures |
| **Reproducibility**      | Ensuring the same results across environments          |
| **Cost of Deployment**   | High computation or storage cost (esp. for DL models)  |

### **5. Ethical and Social Challenges**

| Challenge                | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fairness**             | Avoiding biased decisions in sensitive domains (e.g., hiring, loans) |
| **Transparency**         | Need for explainability in regulated industries                      |
| **Accountability**       | Determining responsibility for model predictions                     |
| **Security**             | Adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model theft                     |
| **Environmental Impact** | Energy consumption in training large models (e.g., LLMs)             |

### **6. Team and Process Challenges**

| Challenge               | Description                                                               |

| **Skill Gaps**          | Lack of cross-functional knowledge (e.g., statistics, engineering)        |
| **Tooling Complexity**  | Too many tools and frameworks; steep learning curve                       |
| **Communication**       | Difficulty aligning data scientists, engineers, and business stakeholders |
| **Experiment Tracking** | Hard to compare and manage multiple runs without proper tracking systems  |
