## **Definition of Machine Learning (ML)**

---

### **Core Definition**

> **Machine Learning** is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn patterns and make decisions **from data** without being explicitly programmed for every task.

| **Tom Mitchell (1997)**  | *“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and performance measure P, if its performance at task T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”* |

### **Key Concepts in the Definition**

* **Learning**: Improving performance through experience (data).
* **Generalization**: Making accurate predictions on unseen data.
* **Model**: Mathematical representation learned from data.
* **Algorithm**: Process or method to train the model on data.
